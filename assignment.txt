React Assignment

For this assignment, we want to give you all the opportunity to choose an application that you'd like to build over the next 
couple of weeks. You should be thinking of this as a project that you will add to your resume or portfolio. You will 
work on the project in multiple iterations, with deliverables for each day of work that build upon the concepts we have covered
in morning lessons. Choose an application from the examples below and complete the deliverables for this iteration outlined below.



Personal Budget Tracker (Easy): This is a simple application that allows users to manage their personal finances.

To-Do List (Easy): A classic application to help users manage their tasks.

Recipe Finder (Medium): This application allows users to search for recipes based on various criteria.

Book Review Forum (Medium): This application allows users to search for books, read and post reviews, and save favorite books.



Deliverables for Iteration 2:



Recipe Finder

Expand the existing React project with the file structure created in Iteration 1.
Implement state management using React's useState hook to store and update the list of recipes.
Add functionality to allow users to search for recipes based on various criteria (e.g., ingredient, cuisine, etc.).
Style the list of recipes using CSS to enhance the user experience.
